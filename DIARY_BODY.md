# The diary body

Two writers, one page, one symbol at a time. The user's idea (2026-09-02):
like the diary in the Chamber of Secrets, both hands write into the same
stream on a shared clock; there are no turns, no end-of-utterance marks,
no breath, no hush. Silence is a symbol the body must choose, and your
face on its noise and on its quiet is how it learns when to be still.

## What it is

- **Alphabet:** printable ASCII plus newline, 96 symbols, and the
  organism's specials (`data/tok_char.json`, 107 ids; `<pad>` is silence).
- **One stream, two hands.** Each tick has two positions: your symbol (or
  silence) as speaker 0, then its symbol (or silence) as speaker 1. A
  fixed small speaker vector joins each embedding, so a blank body tells
  the two hands apart from birth. Simultaneity lives at the tick; the
  trunk still reads one sequence. Two symbols are never blended into one
  position (that is noise, not a conversation).
- **The ear writes, the mouth does not,** now inside the model by the
  speaker channel: only speaker 0's symbols become memory values.
- **Three hands in the bag.** The first GPU run showed the newborn mouth
  babbling between your letters as you typed, and its junk letters became
  part of the keys your sentences were stored under. So the mouth has two
  hands: a letter it writes from memory (speaker 2) joins the thought and
  advances the echo; a letter it writes from noise (speaker 1) is in the
  stream but not in the bag.
- **Memory over letters:** the same content-keyed store with a running
  bag (decay 0.92 per symbol) that fades in silence (x0.6 per silent
  tick), so a pause separates one thought from the next without a mark;
  kernel sharpness 4.5. Measured on a random 2-layer body, letter by
  letter through the two-hand stream: "The s" -> "un is hot and bright.",
  "Cold w" -> "ater freezes into hard ice.", repeated cues intact, its own
  echoed letters never poison the page. An untaught cue babbles, because
  nothing stops it but your face.
- **Faces per tick,** as in the word body; credit by eligibility traces;
  doses become rolling instead of per-utterance.
- **Same nights, same cortisol** (a cost per emitted symbol), same
  doctrine, same instruments (its face, mood, reward, stress, uncertainty,
  memory votes).

## The body

`data/organism_diary_0p5b.pt`: conceived from nothing, d 1024 x 29
layers, untied head, content keys 40/0.92, kernel 4.5, three hands
(speakers 3), silence decay 0.6:

```bash
python3 scripts/conceive.py data/organism_diary_0p5b.pt data/tok_char.json \
    --d 1024 --n-layers 29 --content-keys --kc-w 40 --kc-decay 0.92 --kernel 4.5 \
    --speakers 3 --sil-decay 0.6
```

## What to expect

Letters are five times slower than words and a blank trunk learns
letters before words, so the trunk lags even further behind than in the
word body. The memory carries the diary behavior from the first day:
what you write, it can write back from a few letters. The first thing
your face has to teach is silence; until then it fills every quiet tick
with noise.

## Day 1 (Opus, 2026-09-02, 25 minutes, six sentences written twice)

Shadowing on 18 of 18 writings: on a second pass it rode the whole
sentence one letter behind with 30 memory-backed letters. Recall after a
cue failed every time, and the memory-vote instrument showed why: the
votes were right ("Snow c-o-vers" in order) while the hand wrote a
carrier letter. Twenty frowns did not teach quiet; they moved the babble
from one carrier to the next ("}", "i", "a", "s", "f", "n", "g", "b").
Mood sat at the floor all session. After the night it wrote "Rain S"
unprompted from memory and repeated it every 39 ticks.

Four causes, four fixes:

- **A thought faded too fast.** The bag lost 40% per silent tick, so a
  four-second pause erased the cue before the mouth could use it. Now 5%
  per silent tick: a thought lasts about half a minute of silence.
- **A frown lowered letters but never raised silence.** THE QUIET LESSON:
  a frown on babble, and a smile on quiet, both set the target at the
  mouth's recent positions to silence, one gradient step at the diary's
  live rate. The trunk's cheapest attractor becomes the right one.
- **Stress and mood were miscalibrated.** Each symbol now adds twice the
  stress (a physiological brake toward silence under nonstop babble) and
  a fifth of the mood cost.
- **An empty page recalled beginnings.** The first symbol of a thought was
  written under an empty key, and an empty bag matched it. No context, no
  key: such positions are not stored. (This applies to the word body too.)

The page now shows its memory-backed letters in brown and its noise in
pale sand, so the two hands are visible.

Measured after the fixes (a fresh conception): eight face lessons took
the babble fraction from 1.0 to 0.0 in under a minute, and the trunk's
uncertainty fell to 0.0: it had learned silence completely. It overshot:
certain silence also silenced recall (a cue that had just echoed "Rain
falls" came back empty). Hence one more disclosed rule, a memory is a
reason to speak: when the memory has a vote above its floor, its top
symbol's logit is raised to at least the silence logit plus 2, so a trunk
that has learned quiet does not silence what it remembers. The day-1 body is kept as
`organism_diary_0p5b_day1.pt`; day 2 starts from a fresh conception.

## The thought, measured (2026-09-02, CPU harness with the mouth writing)

Recall failed whenever the mouth wrote during the lessons, and the
memory-vote instrument found three reasons, each now a rule:

- **Noise must leave the thought untouched.** A noise letter was fading
  the running bag like a silent tick, so keys were written into a decayed
  context and cues never matched them. Now a noise letter neither adds to
  nor fades the thought; only silence fades it.
- **A memory letter joins the thought only when your hand is still.**
  While you write, its shadowing letters interleaved with yours inside
  the bag and corrupted the keys; now they stay out, and only a completion
  written while you are silent advances the thought.
- **A new line ends a thought.** With a slow fade (5% per silent tick) the
  previous sentence's residue outweighed a five-letter cue; with a fast
  fade a two-second typing pause erased the sentence. The symbol you
  already use to separate thoughts resolves it: a new line clears the bag.
  Start every sentence and every cue on a new line.
- **No parroting.** The one-letter-behind echo is a memory alias (the
  key of the letter just written is almost the current bag), so the mouth
  may not repeat, in the same tick, the letter you just typed.

With all four, on a random body with the mouth babbling through three
sentences written twice: "My do" -> "g sleeps under a wooden table.",
"Green" -> " leaves move when wind blows hard.", "Rain " -> "falls on the
cold grey", and an untaught cue babbles until your face teaches quiet.

## Status

- model: speaker channel, ear-writes by speaker, running bag with
  silence decay — built and measured on CPU (2026-09-02).
- serve: `scripts/diary.py` — the tick loop (two forwards per tick: your
  symbol as the ear, its symbol as the mouth), the page (your letters
  black, its letters brown; arrow keys move your face; Enter is a new
  line), rolling doses by the word body's thresholds, the same nights,
  save and reset. Smoked on a tiny CPU body (2026-09-02): ticks, both
  hands on the page, faces felt, a night, a morning.
- first serve: the word body is parked after seven days; the diary body
  runs on port 8018:

```bash
python3 scripts/diary.py data/organism_diary_0p5b.pt data/tok_char.json --dev mps --port 8018 \
    --temp 0.05 --store-read-beta 1.0 --store-boost 16 --store-boost-min 0.15 \
    --live-lr 1e-5 --store-decay 0.9 --save data/organism_diary_0p5b.pt --diary-period 0.5
```

The live rate is ten times the word body's on purpose: the first thing
frowns must teach a newborn mouth is silence, which is the cheapest
attractor a trunk can fall into, so here the collapse the word body had
to avoid is the lesson.

Reflexes it keeps from the word body: press marks banned (silence is
allowed), a sure memory speaks with one voice while the trunk is unsure
(6 logits), stress favours silence (0.5 logits per unit, applied before
the memory rule), the face lesson every tick. Its own: a memory is a
reason to speak (memory's top symbol is raised to at least the silence
logit plus 4, so neither learned quiet nor stress cuts a recall short;
without this ordering a recall broke off after six to ten letters), no
parroting (it may not repeat the letter you just typed in the same tick),
the quiet lesson, and a new line ends a thought. Reflexes it drops: the breath, the hush, the end-is-an-end
rule, the bag reset (silence fades the bag instead).
